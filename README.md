# Stacking Regressor and Regression MLP to Predict House Prices <br>
The aim of this project was to build models to make prediction of house prices. These predictions were made using 79 variables regarding residential homes collected in Ames, Iowa. Models were first trained then tuned and combined in ensemble. These were contrasted against a neural network using ELU activation and He initialisation. The stacking ensemble achieved the best results with a root mean squared error of 0.14097 compared to the neural network with 0.17943. It is suggested that further improvements can be achieved by reducing the influence of outliers.
